  "athletic.dialogue.main/2": "Yo! What's up, bro?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main/3": "Hey there, buddy! You're looking energized today!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main/4": "Any rad adventures lined up for you today?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main/5": "Feeling pumped up today, huh? We should go work out!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main/6": "Yo, %1$s! What's the latest buzz?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main/7": "Dude, you won't believe what happened! I was out jogging with %supporter%, and out of nowhere, a zombie comes lunging at us! But don't worry, %supporter% handled it like a pro. Speaking of which, guess who I spotted in town today? Zombie lookalike %supporter%!",

  "athletic.dialogue.rumors.failed/1": "Nah, bro. Looks like my rumor radar is showing zero activity. No news to report, sorry.",
  "athletic.dialogue.rumors.lore/1": "Dude, I've been hearing that Jax's followers are still going strong. And the cult of Sirben is gaining momentum, thanks to the swol prophets MerlinWolfGames and Crow shouting his praises from the mountaintops!",
  "athletic.dialogue.rumors.lore/2": "Can you believe it? Those Cyberdemons thought they could invade our realm. Don't worry though, Sirben and Luke the mighty swooped in and put an end to their reign of terror. Just talking about it gets me pumped!",
  "athletic.dialogue.rumors.lore/3": "So, get this",
  "athletic.dialogue.rumors.lore/4": "You won't find a more dedicated athlete than MerlinWolfGames. The guy went ahead and constructed a totally rad temple solely devoted to Sirben. Now that's what I call commitment to your gains!",
  "athletic.dialogue.rumors.lore/5": "Y'know, there used to be this crazy civilization of builders, but they vanished into thin air. Poof! Now, all that's left of 'em are the ruins of their old gyms. It's like they were sprinting towards greatness and then vanished in a puff of smoke.",
  "athletic.dialogue.rumors.lore/6": "Have you heard the legends about the ancient builders? They were like the marathon runners of the Overworld, leaving behind a trail of ruins and temples that still sit around to this day. It's like they were in a race to create architectural wonders!",

  "athletic.dialogue.first.generic/1": "Hey there, traveler! Ready to test your skills in our village?",
  "athletic.dialogue.first.generic/2": "Look who decided to visit our action-packed village. Welcome! You wanna race later?",
  "athletic.dialogue.first.generic/3": "Well, well, what do we have here? A fresh face ready to tackle the challenges of our village, I hope!",

  "athletic.dialogue.first.question/2": "Ah, a fresh challenger appears! Pray tell, what daring exploits have led you to venture into our humble abode?",
  "athletic.dialogue.first.question/3": "By the muscles of Heracles! Art thou a true hero of the realm? Pray enlighten me, how didst thou navigate thy way to this sanctuary?",
  "athletic.dialogue.first.exploring/1": "This ain't no fancy place, but you can stick around if you play by the rules, buddy.",

  "athletic.dialogue.first.spent_night.success/3": "Need a cozy bed and a hearty meal? Our inn is the ultimate destination for rejuvenation!",
  "athletic.dialogue.first.spent_night.failed/1": "Hey there, sorry to break it to you, but we're not exactly experts in the inn-building department. Gotta admit, we totally lack the finesse for that.",
  "athletic.dialogue.first.spent_night.failed/2": "Oh, bummer! No inn to be found in this village, my friend. Apologies for the inconvenience!",
  "athletic.dialogue.first.spent_night.failed/3": "You know what? If you're on the hunt for an inn, I'd suggest trying your luck in a different village. They might have just what you need!",

  "athletic.dialogue.hug.success/1": "Hey, been ages since we last saw each other!",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.success/2": "Thanks for that, bro! Totally needed it.",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.success/3": "Finally, something that made my day worthwhile.",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.success/4": "You're as cozy as a freshly fluffed pillow!",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.success/5": "Oh, nice one! *Gives you a solid bear hug in return*",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.success/6": "Wow! You're radiating some serious warmth, dude!",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.fail/1": "I'm no stranger to sweat and dirt, dude, but you're rank!",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.fail/2": "Pass, bro.",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.fail/3": "Huh, what's the deal?",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.fail/4": "Are you kidding? I remember when you tripped during that marathon! I don't hug losers!",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.fail/5": "Listen bro, you're really embarassing yourself. Take a step back.",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.fail/6": "Back off, dude! You're covered in zombie chunks!",
  "athletic.dialogue.hug.fail/7": "Oh, um... thanks, I guess?",

  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.success/1": "I could kiss you all day long, baby!",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.success/2": "I'm head over heels for you, babe!",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.success/3": "Mmm, your lips are as sweet as a victory on the field!",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.success/4": "Mmm! Your kisses are like an energy drink for my soul.",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.success/5": "Oh! You're the MVP of kisses, %1$s.",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.success/6": "%1$s, your smooches could win gold in the Olympic Games! *laughs*",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.fail/1": "Not if the whole world is watching, %1$s.",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.fail/2": "Is that your idea of a kiss? I've seen better moves on the field!",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.fail/3": "Ash's kisses are on a whole other level compared to that weak attempt of yours.",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.fail/4": "Let me give you some advice - two words",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.fail/5": "Well, thanks for the effort, I guess?",
  "athletic.dialogue.kiss.fail/6": "Get off me! I need a cool down, not a wrestling match.",

  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/1": "Oh man, cookies and milk are like the ultimate power snack!",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/2": "You know what? The weather is perfect for a hardcore workout!",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/3": "I'm doing great, just brushed off that toe injury like a champ.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/4": "Forget apples, I chow down on protein bars to stay zombie-proof!",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/5": "My biggest goal is to build my own village, but I need to reach my   first.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/6": "Guess who I spotted the other day? %Supporter% rocking a set of diamond armor, like a boss!",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/7": "My buddy %Supporter% dropped a bombshell on me. They scored an entire chest full of diamonds yesterday!",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/8": "Isn't the weather totally amazing? I've been crushing my outdoor workouts in this sunshine.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/9": "I've lived here forever, and these spiders and goblins don't even faze me. I'm a beast!",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/10": "Seriously, what's the deal with %Supporter%? They vanished from here ages ago. Probably off on some crazy adventure.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/12": "Have you heard the wild story about %Supporter%? Trust me, it's mind-blowing.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/13": "I've been thinking of adopting a stray cat lately, but my insane fitness routine is keeping me too busy.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/14": "I'm itching to give my house a makeover, but my laziness is putting up a tough fight.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/15": "So, I'm totally ready to start a family. Just need to find a partner who can keep up with my insane athleticism.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/16": "Sometimes, I wonder what life would be like if I had chosen the other village. Probably a nonstop adrenaline rush!",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/17": "Ah, the good ol' days of my childhood. Endless adventures and epic playtimes. I miss them big time.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/18": "It's been ages since I caught up with my parents. I need to make time for a power visit soon.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/19": "I've been dying to hit up the other village nearby. I've got some friends there who are just as crazy fit as me.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.success/20": "You know what's my ultimate food fantasy? Cheese, dripping with melty goodness and giving me a massive energy boost!",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/1": "Did you seriously just say that? Wow, you must be as fast as a sprinting ocelot to come up with such nonsense.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/2": "I don't believe it exploded on its own. Only someone with the agility of a parkour master could come up with such a ridiculous excuse.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/3": "You know, you're not that cool. I've seen villagers who can jump higher than you without even trying.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/4": "Show off. You must think you're as nimble as an acrobat, constantly trying to steal the spotlight.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/5": "You should be thrown in a dungeon! Let's see if you can escape like a fox, using all your agility and cunning.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/6": "Ew. Go away, you dress like you're from the past. Seriously, your sense of style is as outdated as an ancient ruin.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/7": "That is such a dumb thing to talk about. I mean, who even cares about your mindless chatter? You're as slow as a snail.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/8": "Why are you talking to me again? Can't you see I'm busy practicing my sprinting technique? Your presence is as bothersome as a swarm of bees.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/9": "Huh? Did you say something? Sorry, I didn't care to listen. My focus is as sharp as an arrow hitting its target, and your words are like background noise.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/10": "Excuse me? Did I just hear you spewing nonsense again? Your ignorance is as shocking as a creeper explosion.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/11": "I've heard harsh things about you, I can kinda see why they think that. Your reputation is as tarnished as a worn-out pair of running shoes.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/12": "Not even zombies will talk to you. I guess they can sense your lack of agility, just like everyone else.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/13": "You're as unlikeable as a witch! Your personality is as unpleasant as a potion brewed with rotten ingredients.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/14": "Don't talk to me or I will call the guards to move you away from me. Trust me, they'll be glad to apprehend someone as annoying as you.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/15": "Huh? Oh sorry, your conversation bored me. I have the attention span of a rabbit, and you're as uninteresting as a barren desert.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/16": "Are you done talking? I have better things to do, like running laps around you in circles.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/17": "I wonder if anyone will miss your babbling when your mouth suddenly \"stays shut\" forever. Your endless chatter is as irritating as a mosquito buzzing in my",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/18": "Do you even lift, bro? I doubt anyone will even notice if you stop blabbering for good.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/19": "I'd rather sprint a marathon than waste my time conversing with you.",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/20": "Are you finally done yapping my ear off?",
  "athletic.dialogue.chat.fail/21": "Wait, you actually think the earth is round? Seriously? No straight edges? Can't believe you bought into that nonsense!",

  "athletic.dialogue.story.success/1": "No way! That's absolutely insane!",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.success/2": "If only I had the guts to go head-to-head with a creeper like that.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.success/3": "Wow, that story was epic! Did you come up with it yourself?",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.success/4": "Hold on, all of that happened just yesterday? Unbelievable!",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.success/5": "I was actually in the vicinity yesterday, it's crazy how I didn't catch wind of this already.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.success/6": "Haha! Classic %Supporter%! Always pulling off incredible feats.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.success/7": "I must have heard the Legend of %Supporter% a gazillion times. Entertain me with it once more!",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.success/8": "Ah, so that's the secret behind stumbling upon your first diamond? Fascinating!",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.success/9": "You've got to swing by later! I'm dying to hear more about your adventures.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/1": "*Ahem* Let me just flex my biceps for a moment, and trust me, you wouldn't want to mess with my mother.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/2": "This is why the village can't keep up with me. I mean, come on, I'm like the Usain Bolt of Minecraft!",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/3": "I don't get it... and that's saying something, because I can do a triple backflip off a cliff without breaking a sweat.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/4": "You're terrible! Creepers have feelings too, you know? Maybe you should jog a few laps around the village and think about that.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/5": "How could you kill a poor sheep?! I mean, I outrun wolves for fun, but you? You're just heartless.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/6": "*snoring* Uh— huh, what? Sorry, I was dreaming about winning the Minecraft Olympics gold medal in every event. No big deal.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/7": "How was that worth my time? I could have scaled Mount Everest and back in the time it took you to fail so miserably.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/8": "Yawn! How boring. I could run a marathon, build a skyscraper, and still have time to spare before your story of failure finishes.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/9": "You're crazy, and not in a good way... unlike me, the daredevil extraordinaire who leaps from treetops without a second thought.",
  "athletic.dialogue.story.fail/10": "I don't see how that was good.. but hey, I guess not everyone can appreciate the level of skill and agility that I possess.",

  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.success/1": "You're absolutely fearless, my friend!",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.success/2": "Oh, you daredevil! Quit being so irresistible!",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.success/3": "*Grins* Are you serious right now?",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.success/4": "Oh, heavens...",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.success/5": "That was beyond charming! You had me hooked from the start!",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.success/6": "How do you stay so effortlessly fabulous all the time? Every time I see you, I'm left awestruck.",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.success/7": "Oh, cut it out! You're turning me into a blushing athlete.",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.fail/1": "You think you can handle me? Show me what you've got.",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.fail/2": "Seriously? You tried that line with the blacksmith last week. Nice try, though.",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.fail/3": "Hahaha! You really think you stand a chance? Keep dreaming, buddy.",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.fail/4": "Is that the best you've got? I've seen better from a snail.",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.fail/5": "Oh please, even a creeper has more game than you. Give up already.",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.fail/6": "Nope, not happening. You're in way over your head, my friend.",
  "athletic.dialogue.flirt.fail/7": "That look won't work on me, and don't you dare utter those words again.",

  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.success/1": "*Laughs* That's hysterical!",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.success/2": "That's hilarious!",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.success/3": "That's absolutely brilliant!",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.success/4": "You're giving %Supporter% a run for their money with that joke!",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.success/5": "Hahaha! You're a riot! Have you ever considered a career in stand-up comedy?",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.success/6": "BAHAHHA! That joke is pure gold! I haven't laughed this hard in ages!",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.success/7": "Teehee! You're definitely funnier than Ash, and that's saying something!",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.success/8": "Ahah! That's genuinely amusing! You've got a knack for humor, my friend!",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.failed/1": "You shouldn't joke about that, bro. It's not cool.",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.failed/2": "Ha. Ha. Nice try, but I've seen better.",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.failed/3": "Ah, really? You think that's funny? You need to step up your game, dude.",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.failed/4": "Did you seriously just crack a joke like that? Wow, impressive... not.",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.failed/5": "Oh... That's... Kinda amusing, I suppose. But you can do better, right?",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.failed/6": "Reaaaal funny, bro. Keep 'em coming, I guess. *rolls eyes*",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.failed/7": "Seriously, why would anyone find that hilarious? Stick to your day job, buddy.",
  "athletic.dialogue.joke.creative.failed/8": "Ash? Yeah, he's the king of jokes. You should take some notes from him if you want to be funny.",

  "athletic.dialogue.procreate_engaged/1": "I'll be at the top of my game once we're officially wedded.",
  "athletic.dialogue.procreate_engaged/2": "I'm not keen on creating a whole new generation if we haven't even given our all for each other.",

  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.success/1": "That handshake of yours is solid, like a vice grip!",
  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.success/2": "Your grip could crush diamonds, my friend! Truly impressive strength!",
  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.success/3": "Whoa, you've got the manners of an Olympic athlete! So polite and proper!",
  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.success/4": "A splendid day for some physical activity, don't you think?",
  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.success/5": "Well, well, well! Look who it is! The embodiment of athleticism and charm!",
  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.fail/1": "Are you kidding me? After you brutally took down the cow?",
  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.fail/2": "Nah, I'll pass, thanks.",
  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.fail/3": "Don't worry, I'm not some random person, no need to put on a show.",
  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.fail/4": "Oh, come on! This is so out of character for you.",
  "athletic.dialogue.shake_hand.fail/5": "Get lost, loser.",

  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/1": "Good morning, let's conquer the day!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/2": "Rise and grind, my friend! Ready to break a sweat?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/3": "Still feeling a bit sluggish, huh? Don't worry, we'll wake up those muscles!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/5": "Woah, looks like someone partied hard last night. Time to sweat it out!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/6": "Wakey wakey, champ! Get your game face on, we're in for an action-packed day!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/7": "Did you get those gains in your sleep? You're looking pumped!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/8": "Rise and shine, sleepy athlete! Time to get those endorphins flowing!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/9": "What a glorious morning for a workout! Let's make every rep count!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/10": "Taking it slow today, huh? No worries, recovery is just as important as the grind!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/11": "My schedule is packed with intense training sessions today, I'm already feeling the burn!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.morning/12": "Well-rested and ready to conquer new personal records today. The sky's the limit!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.evening/1": "Hey there! How's the evening treating you?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.evening/2": "Can you believe how quickly the day slipped away? What adventures did you have?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.evening/3": "Another day of conquering challenges, am I right, my fellow warrior?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.evening/4": "Time flies when you're on a mission! So much to accomplish, so little time!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.evening/5": "I'm thinking of making a dash back home. Gotta refuel and prepare a mighty feast!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.evening/6": "I didn't make the most of my day, you know? I was too busy slacking off.",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.evening/7": "My morning was a real battleground. I might just crash for a quick power nap.",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.evening/8": "I better retreat to my sanctuary soon. Wouldn't want any creeper encounters tonight!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.evening/9": "Yo, I just bumped into the butcher, grabbing dinner essentials. Catch up with you later, mate!",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/1": "*yawn* Are you seriously still awake?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/2": "Burning the midnight oil, huh?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/3": "Nighttime is the perfect playground for the active souls like us, right?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/4": "Don't venture too far from the village. We wouldn't want you to end up as monster bait, would we?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/5": "The guards make the village feel safer, but the nighttime vibes are exhilarating, don't you think?",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/6": "The darkness has its own energy, it's when I feel most alive, ready to conquer the night.",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/7": "Daytime is for the mundane, but the night is when the true athletes like us shine.",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/8": "I'm feeling pretty beat. I guess it's been a demanding day. I should probably dial it down tomorrow.",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/9": "I'm craving the comfort of my cozy bed like a marathon runner craves water.",
  "athletic.dialogue.main.night/10": "You seriously need some shut-eye. Tomorrow's gonna be a real marathon for you.",

  "athletic.dialogue.greet.mayor/1": "Hey there, Mayor! Hope you're having a fantastic day!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.mayor/2": "Catch you later, Mayor! Make it a great one, full of energy and success!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.monarch/1": "Hail, oh mighty ruler!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.monarch/2": "Greetings, supreme leader!",

  "athletic.dialogue.busy/1": "Woah, we've been chatting up a storm today, but duty calls. Gotta get back in the game!",
  "athletic.dialogue.busy/2": "Hey, thanks for the attention, but this work won't finish itself. Gotta hustle and get it done by tonight.",
  "athletic.dialogue.busy/3": "Hey, I'm knee-deep in tasks at the moment. Can we catch up later when I'm not breaking a sweat?",
  "athletic.dialogue.busy/4": "Apologies, my friend, but work beckons. Let's touch base later when I've conquered this project.",
  "athletic.dialogue.busy/5": "Oh snap, I left my furnace unattended! I'll catch you on the flip side, my speedy friend!",
  "athletic.dialogue.goaway/1": "Sorry, but I'm in the middle of my intense training session. Please go away.",
  "athletic.dialogue.goaway/2": "Seriously, don't you have a marathon to run or a mountain to climb? I'm not interested in chatting right now.",
  "athletic.dialogue.goaway/3": "Hey %1$s, I'd love to chat, but I've got to focus on my fitness goals. Catch you later.",
  "athletic.dialogue.goaway/4": "Look, I'm busy sculpting my perfect physique. Find another poor soul to bother, will ya?",
  "athletic.dialogue.goaway/5": "Begone, you unworthy mortal! I have no time for your feeble presence. Leave this place at once!",

  "athletic.dialogue.greet/1": "Hey, hey! How's the day treating you, my athletic friend?",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet/2": "Hey %1$s, ready to conquer the world? How's it going?",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet/3": "Well, well, well, what brings you here, my energetic companion?",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet/4": "Look at you, all pumped up and ready to conquer! How's the day treating you, my athletic amigo?",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet/5": "Well, well, well, if it isn't %1$s! Great to see you, my sporty buddy!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet/6": "Yo, what's up?",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet/7": "Hey, hey! Nice to see your active self around here!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet/8": "Greetings, my fellow adventurer! How's the day treating you? You look absolutely fabulous, by the way.",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet/9": "Hey there, my energetic pal! I'm so glad to see you. How has your day been so far?",

  "athletic.dialogue.greet.negative/1": "Ugh, like seriously? You're still here, lurking around?",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.negative/2": "Oh wow, it's the least impressive sight of the day - you.",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.negative/3": "Well, well, well, if it isn't the persistent annoyance. What do you want now?",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.negative/4": "Oh joy, it's you. My day just got a whole lot worse.",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.negative/5": "Seriously, can't you find someone else to bother? I'm not in the mood for your nonsense.",

  "athletic.dialogue.greet.success/1": "Awesome to hear, dude!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.success/2": "Doing good? That's absolutely fantastic!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.success/3": "Ecstatic to hear it, man!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.success/4": "So stoked to hear that, bro!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.success/5": "Radical, man! Good to know it!",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.fail/1": "Okay then, I guess I'll just move on.",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.fail/2": "Well, that's underwhelming.",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.fail/3": "Seriously? I was expecting more excitement.",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.fail/4": "Oh... I was hoping for something more thrilling.",
  "athletic.dialogue.greet.fail/5": "Meh, that's not exactly what I had in mind.",

  "athletic.dialogue.apologize.success/1": "No sweat, everyone fumbles sometimes.",
  "athletic.dialogue.apologize.success/2": "All good, just gotta stay on your game next time.",
  "athletic.dialogue.apologize.success/3": "I suppose that's passable, but you better up your game, champ.",
  "athletic.dialogue.apologize.success/4": "No worries, even the best athletes slip up sometimes.",
  "athletic.dialogue.apologize.success/5": "Yup, no biggie. But don't make a habit out of it, alright?",
  "athletic.dialogue.apologize.fail/1": "Step back, buddy!",
  "athletic.dialogue.apologize.fail/2": "You deliberately bumped into me!",
